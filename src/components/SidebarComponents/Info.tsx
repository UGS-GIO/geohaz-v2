            The Utah Geologic Hazards Database contains geologic hazard information and data from the Utah Geological Survey (UGS)
            and other sources for the area of interest shown on the interactive map and can be used to identify mapped geologic hazards in an area,
            understand what the hazards are, and some potential ways to mitigate them.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            The database is periodically updated to incorporate the results of new mapping and/or updated mapping due to
            updated data and/or methodology; however, more-detailed fault traces and paleoseismic information may be available
            in recently published geologic maps and reports, so the database should not be considered exhaustive.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Locations of mapped geologic hazards should always be considered approximate.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            The locational accuracy of  hazards on the maps vary, and spatial error can be substantial when viewing structures
            at high zoom levels that were originally mapped at small scales. Therefore, the locations of hazards on the map should
            be considered approximate. Depending on the ultimate needs of the user, a site-specific investigation by a qualified
            Utah-licensed Professional Geologist may be required to accurately characterize the hazards at a particular site.
