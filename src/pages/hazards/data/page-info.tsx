            In 2008, the Utah Geological Survey Geologic Hazards Mapping Initiative was created with funding from the Utah Legislature to map geologic hazards in areas of existing and future development. This mapping is focused on identifying hazards for 7.5′ quadrangles at 1:24,000 scale with a focus on hazards associated with earthquakes, landslides, flooding, debris flows, indoor radon, shallow groundwater, rockfall, and problem soils and rocks. The initiative is intended to provide planners, local officials, property owners, developers, engineers, geologists, design professionals, and the interested public with information on the type and location of critical geologic hazards that may impact existing and future development.

            The Utah Geologic Hazards Database contains geologic hazard information and data from the Utah Geological Survey (UGS) and other sources for the area of interest shown on the interactive map and can be used to identify mapped geologic hazards in an area, understand what the hazards are, and some potential ways to mitigate them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The database is periodically updated to incorporate the results of new mapping and/or updated mapping due to updated data and/or methodology; however, more-detailed fault traces and paleoseismic information may be available in recently published geologic maps and reports, so the database should not be considered exhaustive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Locations of mapped geologic hazards should always be considered approximate.
        </p>
        <p>
            The locational accuracy of hazards on the maps varies, and spatial error can be substantial when viewing structures at high zoom levels that were originally mapped at small scales. Therefore, the locations of hazards on the map should be considered approximate. Depending on the ultimate needs of the user, a site-specific investigation by a qualified Utah-licensed Professional Geologist may be required to accurately characterize the hazards at a particular site.

            The Utah Geologic Hazards Portal is a compilation of data from the Utah Geologic Hazards Database and contains post-2008 UGS geologic hazard map data and data from other sources. This mapping is intended to provide planners, local government officials, property owners, developers, engineers, geologists, design professionals, and the public with information on the type, location, and relative susceptibility of geologic hazards that may impact existing and future infrastructure and development. The data also supports emergency response and recovery planning, as well as community risk assessment for existing development and infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hazard map layers can be enabled using the group toggle buttons and layer checkboxes. Select features on the map to view detailed information about hazard susceptibilities. Create summary reports for individual areas by using the Report Generator tool.
