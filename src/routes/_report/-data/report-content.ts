    coverPageIntro: `This report contains geologic hazard information and data from the Utah Geological Survey (UGS) and other sources for the area of interest shown on the map below and can be used to identify mapped geologic hazards in an area, understand what the hazards are, and learn potential ways to mitigate them. This report is not a substitute for site-specific geologic hazards and geotechnical engineering investigations by a qualified, Utah-licensed consultant. These investigations provide valuable information on the site geologic conditions that may affect or be affected by development, as well as the type and susceptibility of geologic hazards at a site and recommend solutions to mitigate the effects and costs of the hazards, both at the time of construction and over the life of the development. See your local city or county building department for details on these investigations and UGS Circular 128 (https://doi.org/10.34191/C-128). Since 1850, at least 5797 deaths and an undetermined financial cost have been attributed to geologic hazards in Utah. Damages resulting from many geologic hazards are often not covered by property or other insurance. In almost all cases, it is more cost effective to investigate and characterize potential hazards and implement appropriate mitigation, rather than rely on additional maintenance over the life of a project and/or incur costly construction change orders and other financial costs.`,
