    coverPageIntro: `This report contains geologic hazard information and data from the Utah Geological Survey (UGS) and other sources for the area of interest shown on the map below and can be used to identify mapped geologic hazards in an area, understand what the hazards are, and learn potential ways to mitigate them. This report is not a substitute for site-specific geologic hazards and geotechnical engineering investigations by a qualified, Utah-licensed consultant. These investigations provide valuable information on the site geologic conditions that may affect or be affected by development, as well as the type and susceptibility of geologic hazards at a site and recommend solutions to mitigate the effects and costs of the hazards, both at the time of construction and over the life of the development. See your local city or county building department for details on these investigations and UGS Circular 128 (https://doi.org/10.34191/C-128). Since 1850, at least 5797 deaths and an undetermined financial cost have been attributed to geologic hazards in Utah. Damages resulting from many geologic hazards are often not covered by property or other insurance. In almost all cases, it is more cost effective to investigate and characterize potential hazards and implement appropriate mitigation, rather than rely on additional maintenance over the life of a project and/or incur costly construction change orders and other financial costs.`,

    summary: {
        intro: `Geologic hazards affect Utah, negatively impacting life safety, health, property, and the state's economy. These hazards are those geologic conditions that present a risk to life or of substantial loss or damage of real property, and are generally within five categories: landslide, earthquake (seismic), flooding, problem soil and rock, and volcanic hazards. Although many geologic hazards are not life threatening, they are often costly when not recognized and properly accommodated and mitigated in project planning and design, and may result in additional, significant construction and/or future maintenance costs and injury or death. However, we can live and deal with geologic hazards by understanding what they are, where they exist, how large or difficult they are, and how to effectively mitigate them. Detailed geologic hazard mapping is available for limited areas and for specific hazards in Utah and additional mapping is ongoing. This report represents geologic hazard data extracted from the Utah Geologic Hazards Database of current geologic hazard mapping by the UGS for part of Utah and from other sources at the date and time indicated on the cover page. For each of the major geologic hazard categories (earthquake, landslide, flooding, and problem soil and rock) mapped in Utah, a summary page is available that describes the hazard category and the individual types of hazards within that category. Following the summary page, are detailed pages for each mapped hazard type that contain a brief description of that hazard type, a map of your area of interest and the mapped hazard susceptibility, a brief discussion on the susceptibility rankings and their meaning, and a list of references and other information on that hazard type. The absence of data does not imply that no geologic hazard or hazards exist. Additional geologic hazard mapping is on-going and will be added to the database as it is finalized.`,
        closing: `The database is updated when new geologic hazard mapping is published by the UGS, most commonly in urban areas using 7.5-minute map quadrangles as comprehensive geologic hazard map sets. If mapping is not available for your area of interest at the time this report was created, check the website for updates or contact the UGS at (801) 537-3300 or https://geology.utah.gov/about-us/ask-a-geologist`

        "Earthquake": {
            intro: `<p>Utah has experienced sixteen earthquakes greater than magnitude (M) 5.5 since pioneer settlement in 1847, and geologic investigations of Utah's faults indicate a long geologic history of repeated large earthquakes of M 6.5 and greater prior to settlement. Although Utah is not on a boundary between tectonic plates where most of the world's earthquakes occur, it is in the tectonically extending western part of the North American plate. Thus, earthquakes in Utah are indirectly caused by interactions with the Pacific plate along the plate margin on the west coast of the United States. Also, many small earthquakes in east-central Utah are induced by underground coal mining. Large, damaging earthquakes in Utah are likely to occur in the Intermountain Seismic Belt (ISB) that generally extends north-south through the center of the state, essentially following Interstate 15, where there are many hazardous faults capable of producing earthquakes. However, areas outside the ISB also experience earthquakes. Moderate to large earthquakes (generally M 6 and greater) can kill and injure many people and cause substantial damage to buildings, roads, bridges, and utilities. The Utah Earthquakes (1850 to 2016) and Quaternary Fault Map (https://ugspub.nr.utah.gov/publications/maps/m-277.pdf) shows earthquakes known to have occurred within and surrounding Utah and mapped Quaternary faults (those with movement in the past 2.6 million years) considered to be earthquake sources.</p><p>Earthquake hazards include:</p><p><strong>Earthquake Ground Shaking</strong> – the sudden motion or trembling of the Earth as stored elastic energy is released by fracture (breaking) and movement of rocks along a fault.</p><p><strong>Surface Fault Rupture</strong> – displacement(s) of the ground surface along a tectonic fault during an earthquake that results in a steep slope known as a scarp.</p><p><strong>Liquefaction</strong> – a sudden, large decrease in strength of a saturated sandy soil caused by a temporary increase in soil water pressure during an earthquake and subsequent collapse of soil structure, resulting in sand boils, differential foundation settlement, and localized flooding.</p><p><strong>Tsunamis</strong> – a series of waves in the ocean or a lake caused by the displacement of a large volume of water, such as from underwater fault rupture or landsliding into the water.</p><p><strong>Seiches</strong> – an oscillating wave in an enclosed body of water, such as a lake, river, canal, or tank, induced by earthquakes or other energy sources.</p><p><strong>Tectonic Deformation</strong> – the lowering and tilting of a valley floor on the down-dropped side of a fault during an earthquake that commonly causes localized flooding and gravity-flow utility failure.</p><p><strong>Earthquake – Triggered Landslides and Rockfall</strong> – landslides and rockfall triggered by earthquake ground shaking.</p><p><strong>Quick Clays</strong> – typically, marine-type clays that significantly lose strength when subjected to earthquake ground shaking.</p><p>The UGS has mapped surface-fault-rupture and liquefaction earthquake hazards for selected areas, and the U.S. Geological Survey has mapped expected earthquake ground shaking in Utah. The other earthquake hazard types have not yet been mapped in Utah. More information on earthquake hazards are available at https://geology.utah.gov/hazards/earthquakes-faults and https://ussc.utah.gov.

The faults contained in the database are those considered to have been sources of large earthquakes (about magnitude 6.5 or greater) during the Quaternary Period (past 2.6 million years); these geologic structures are the most likely sources of future large earthquakes. The database is intended to be a comprehensive source of the most current information available for characterizing active faults and folds in Utah for seismic-hazard analysis. This version of the database incorporates fault data from geologic maps and other documents formally published through 2013, along with several additional faults.</p><p>The database was compiled and attributed using ESRI ArcGIS geographic information system software.

                    intro: `<p>In the Intermountain West, earthquakes of M 6.5 and larger generally produce surface fault rupture, where the ground on one side of the fault moves upward and the other side moves downward (called a normal fault). These movements of the ground surface along a tectonic fault during an earthquake often produce a steep scarp (slope) or a series of generally parallel scarps. If a fault were to rupture beneath a building or critical structure (tanks, communication towers, electrical substations, etc.) significant structural damage or collapse may occur, possibly causing severe injuries and loss of life. For this reason, the UGS recommends that buildings and structures not be constructed over or directly adjacent to hazardous faults.</p><p>The map below shows where hazardous faults have been mapped, along with UGS-designated and recommended special-study areas (shaded map areas) associated with the mapped faults within the area of interest defined for this report. These special-study areas define locations where the UGS recommends comprehensive, site-specific surface-fault-rupture investigations to accurately locate the hazardous fault and determine appropriate building setback distances following UGS guidelines (https://ugspub.nr.utah.gov/publications/circular/c-122.pdf). Note that developing near hazardous faults will always involve a level of irreducible, inherent risk.</p>`,
                    howToUse: `<p>Your area of interest has a Surface-Fault-Rupture Special Study Area associated with the faults listed above. This means that the site is in the vicinity of a mapped, hazardous fault or faults. The map generated for your area of interest shows the special study zone for potentially active faults along which surface faulting may occur. The UGS recommends a site-specific, surface-fault-rupture hazard investigation be performed prior to development within the special study zone. Site-specific geotechnical/geologic-hazard investigations can resolve uncertainties inherent in the generalized map scale and help ensure safety by identifying the need for fault setbacks. This map is not intended for use at scales other than 1:24,000. Smaller faults may not have been detected during mapping or are concealed beneath young geologic deposits. Additionally, concealed and approximately located faults lack a clearly identifiable surface trace; therefore, their locations are approximate.</p>`,
                    moreInfo: `<p>Although these areas are not regulated on a state-level, many cities and counties throughout Utah have adopted development ordinances requiring a comprehensive, site-specific surface-fault-rupture investigation. Site-specific investigations are necessary to accurately locate the hazardous fault and determine appropriate building setback distances. These setback distances from hazardous faults help to reduce surface fault rupture from occurring beneath buildings and critical facilities, lessening damage, injuries, and loss of life. The UGS offers guidelines for these investigations and recommends that they are conducted as part of the development permitting process.

Based on data from the UGS, the University of Utah Seismograph Stations, and other agencies, the U.S. Geological Survey periodically creates seismic hazard maps of the entire U.S. These maps are used by engineers and architects in designing buildings to meet the seismic requirements of the 2018 International Building Code (IBC) and International Residential Code (IRC), adopted statewide in Utah. Unless the building is specially designed, such as a critical facility (police and fire stations, emergency operations centers, etc.), building “to the code” means that the building is not expected to collapse during an earthquake of a magnitude for which it was designed. However, the building may dangerous and uninhabitable, due to significant structural damage and must then be replaced.</p>

        "Landslide": {
            intro: `<p>A landslide is the downslope movement of rock, soil, and debris, in which much of the material moves as a coherent or semi-coherent mass with little internal deformation and movement typically occurs on either a curved (rotational slide) or flat (translational slide) rupture surface. Occasionally, individual landslides may involve multiple types of movement if conditions change as the displaced material moves downslope. For example, a landslide may initiate as a rotational slide and then become a translational slide as it progresses downslope. Landslides occur in all 50 states; however, the coastal states and the Intermountain West, including Utah, are the primary regions of landslide activity. Nationally, landslides result in 25 to 50 deaths annually and cause approximately $5 billion (2019 dollars) in damage.</p>
                        <p>Since 1850, at least 338 people in Utah have died from landslides. Specific types of landslides are classified by the material involved and the movement type. Material in a landslide can be rock, soil, organic debris, or a combination of these materials, and movement types include fall, topple, slide, and flow. Typical landslides in Utah include slides, rockfalls, debris flows, and earth flows. In Utah, many landslides move slowly, but some move quickly with devastating results. Debris flows, which are a type of landslide having a very high-water content, can travel at speeds greater than 30 to 50 miles per hour. Slope instability can result from many factors, including ground surface topography, water (hydrologic), and geologic conditions.</p>
                        <p>Landslides can be naturally occurring or human-caused. Landslides often result from a rise in groundwater levels caused by increased precipitation, rapid snowmelt, or by human causes, such as landscape irrigation and leakage from water-conveyance structures (reservoirs, ponds, and pipelines). Modification of a slope that results in over-steepening of the slope, either by removal of material from the lower part of the slope or addition of material near its top, can also trigger landslides. Development-related slope modification can include loading by construction of buildings or fill materials, or removal of material during grading for building pads and roadways.</p>
                        <p>Landslide hazards include:</p>
                        <p><strong>Landslide and Debris Avalanches</strong> – a mass-movement involving the downslope transport under gravity of soil and rock materials.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rockfall</strong> – the relatively free-falling or rapid movement of rock from a slope by rolling, falling, toppling, and bouncing.</p>
                        <p><strong>Debris Flows</strong> – a slurry of rock, soil, organic matter, and water that flows down channels and onto valley edges that can travel long distances very quickly.</p>
                        <p><strong>Snow Avalanches</strong> – a large mass of snow and ice that moves rapidly down a mountain slope.</p>
                        <p>The UGS has mapped landslide, rockfall, and debris flow hazards for selected areas in Utah. Snow avalanche hazard potential is generally unmapped in Utah.

                    intro: `<p>Rockfall is a natural mass-wasting (landslide) process that involves the dislodging and rapid downslope movement of individual rocks and rock masses. The widespread combination of steep slopes capped by well-jointed bedrock makes rockfall among the most common landslide types in Utah. Rockfall poses a hazard because falling, rolling, and/or bouncing rocks can cause significant property damage and be life threatening. At least 16 deaths directly attributable to rockfalls have occurred in Utah since 1850. Rockfalls occur where a source of rock exists above a slope steep enough to allow rapid downslope movement of dislodged rocks by falling, rolling, bouncing, and sliding. Rockfall sources include bedrock outcrops or boulders on steep slopes or near the edges of cliffs, bluffs, and terraces. Talus cones and scree-covered slopes are indicators of a high rockfall hazard, but other less obvious areas may also be vulnerable. Most rockfalls originate on slopes steeper than 35 degrees, although rockfall hazards may be found on less-steep slopes. The runout distance for exposed rock can be determined and structures should not be built in the runout zone.</p>
                                        <p>Rockfalls may be triggered by freeze/thaw action, rainfall, changes in groundwater conditions, weathering and erosion of the rock and surrounding material, and root growth. Slope modifications, such as cuts for roads and building pads and clearing slope vegetation for development or from wildfire, can increase or create rockfall hazards, as can construction of non-engineered and poorly constructed rockery walls, which are becoming increasingly common in Utah. Rockfall is the most common landslide type caused by earthquakes. Generally, earthquakes greater than magnitude (M) 4 can trigger rockfalls. In Utah, the 1988 ML 5.3 San Rafael Swell and the 1992 ML 5.8 St. George earthquakes caused many rockfalls. Although not well documented, rockfalls in Utah appear to occur more frequently during the spring and summer, likely due to spring snowmelt, summer storms, and large daily temperature variations. The map below shows the mapped rockfall hazard for your area of interest in relative terms of very high, high, moderate, low, low with a high hazard, or not mapped categories.</p>`,

Areas with no mapped rockfall hazard either do not have the conditions for rockfall present or may be in an area with significant human disturbance, these areas may include quarries, mine pits and dumps, and similar operations. Rockfall hazard can become a hazard in areas with no mapped hazard due to modification of slopes for construction, roads, or natural processes.

Piping can remove support of overlying soil and rock, resulting in collapse. Erosion is the process of material being moved by wind, water, and other processes and can occur at or below the ground surface.</p>
                        <p><strong>Radon Gas</strong> – an odorless, tasteless, and clear radioactive gas resulting from the natural decay of uranium that occurs in nearly all rock and soil, and when concentrated, such as in a building or other confined space can lead to lung cancer.</p>
                        <p><strong>Salt Tectonics</strong> – salt formations at depth below the ground surface may deform, causing deformation and cracks at the ground surface.</p>
                        <p><strong>Shallow Bedrock</strong> – rock at shallow depths that may be encountered in construction and other excavations.</p>
                        <p><strong>Soluble Soil and Rock</strong> – soil and rock that may be dissolved by water, causing ground subsidence.</p>
                        <p><strong>Wind-Blown Sand</strong> – geologically young, active or partially stabilized, deposits characterized by a well-sorted, loose, sandy soil texture with little to no clay.</p>

                    intro: `<p>Radon is an odorless, tasteless, and clear radioactive gas resulting from the natural decay of uranium that is found in nearly all rock and soil. When concentrated, such as in buildings or other confined spaces, radon can lead to lung cancer and is Utah’s leading geologic hazard in terms of fatalities. Over 5630 fatalities resulting from radon gas exposure were documented in Utah between 1973 and 2015, and thousands of fatalities likely occurred before 1973. Radon decays into radioactive particles than can be trapped in the lungs when inhaled. These particles release small bursts of energy that damage lung tissue, leading to lung cancer. Only smoking causes more lung cancer deaths, and smoking, when combined with radon, is a particularly serious health risk. Geologic conditions directly affect indoor radon gas levels; however, indoor radon gas levels are highly dependent on building construction methods. When geologic and building conditions are favorable, the potential increases for high indoor radon gas levels. There is no safe level of exposure to radon gas. The map below shows the mapped geologic radon gas susceptibility for your area of interest in relative terms of high, moderate, low, or not mapped categories.</p>`,
                    howToUse: `<p>The geologic radon susceptibility mapping is intended for general planning purposes to indicate where geologic radon susceptibility may be present and to assist in designing geologic radon-hazard investigations. Your area of interest has an area mapped as having geologic radon susceptibility. The geologic radon susceptibility and the description of the geologic radon susceptibility categories identified in your area of interest are listed above. The UGS recommends radon gas mitigation be performed if indoor radon gas level is greater than or equal to 2.7 picocuries per liter (0.26 gallons) of air and a radon control system be installed for all new construction. There is no safe level of radon gas and concentrations should be reduced as low as possible. For existing buildings, indoor radon gas testing is highly recommended. For proposed building sites, a geotechnical investigation that specifically addresses radon gas is highly recommended to determine if radon gas exists and its concentration.</p>`,
                    moreInfo: `<p>Although these areas are not regulated on a state-level, many cities and counties throughout Utah have adopted development ordinances requiring a comprehensive, site-specific geotechnical and geologic-hazard investigation. Site-specific investigations are necessary to accurately characterize the site-specific geologic radon susceptibility and determine appropriate building requirements. The UGS offers guidelines for these investigations and recommends they are conducted as part of the development permitting process.

                    intro: `<p>Collapsible soils have considerable strength when in a dry, natural state, but significantly settle due to hydrocompaction when wetted. Typically, they are associated with young alluvial fans, debris flows, and loess (wind-blown silts), where soil structure creates a significant amount of air space within the soil and includes certain rock units that weather in-place to soil. Collapsible soils may cause extensive damage to building foundations, asphalt and concrete slabs and pavements, and buried utilities and other infrastructure if not identified, investigated, and mitigated prior to the construction of buildings, pavements, and utilities. Often, these soils can be mitigated by over excavating and recompacting or removal of the collapse susceptible soils.

These changes in volume can cause cracked foundations and other structural damage to buildings, asphalt and concrete pavements, and underground utilities, heaving and cracking of canals and road surfaces, and the failure of septic disposal systems.
