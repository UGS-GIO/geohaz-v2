            In 2008, the Utah Geological Survey Geologic Hazards Mapping Initiative was created with funding from the Utah Legislature to map geologic hazards in areas of existing and future development. This mapping is focused on identifying hazards for an entire 7.5â€² quadrangle at 1:24,000 scale, instead of single hazard maps of large regional areas. The geologic-hazard maps address hazards associated with earthquakes, landslides, flooding, debris flows, indoor radon, shallow groundwater, rockfall, and problem soils and rocks. The initiative will provide planners, local officials, property owners, developers, engineers, geologists, design professionals, and the interested public with information on the type and location of critical geologic hazards that may impact existing and future development.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
            Hazard mapping is a multidisciplinary cooperative collaboration. We thank Scott Davis, Nathan Kota, Steve Gourley, and Jake Adams with the Utah Automated Geographic Reference Center (AGRC) for assistance and programming in the creation of the online web mapping application. Steve Bowman and Jessica Castleton (UGS) helped develop the schema and reporting format used in the current database. Marshall Robinson, Jay Hill, Martha Jensen (UGS) and Corey Unger (former UGS) did web design and programming for the interactive map. UGS GIS analyst Gordon Douglass contributed substantially at various stages of development of the database. We thank the hazard mappers in the UGS Geologic Hazards Program for providing high quality hazard maps.

        <p className="mb-2">
            The Utah Geologic Hazards Database contains geologic hazard information and data from the Utah Geological Survey (UGS) and other sources for the area of interest shown on the interactive map and can be used to identify mapped geologic hazards in an area, understand what the hazards are, and some potential ways to mitigate them.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
            The database is periodically updated to incorporate the results of new mapping and/or updated mapping due to updated data and/or methodology; however, more-detailed fault traces and paleoseismic information may be available in recently published geologic maps and reports, so the database should not be considered exhaustive.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
            Locations of mapped geologic hazards should always be considered approximate.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
            The locational accuracy of hazards on the maps varies, and spatial error can be substantial when viewing structures at high zoom levels that were originally mapped at small scales. Therefore, the locations of hazards on the map should be considered approximate. Depending on the ultimate needs of the user, a site-specific investigation by a qualified Utah-licensed Professional Geologist may be required to accurately characterize the hazards at a particular site.

            This Portal is a compilation of data from the Utah Geologic Hazards Database, and contains post-2008 UGS geologic hazard map data and data from other sources for parts of Utah. These data address earthquake, flood, landslide, and problem soil and rock hazards. This web mapping application is intended to provide planners, local government officials, property owners, developers, engineers, geologists, design professionals, and the public with information on the type, location, and relative susceptibility of geologic hazards that may impact existing and future infrastructure and development. The data also provide information that may be used for emergency response and recovery planning and community risk assessment for existing development and infrastructure.

        <p className="mb-2">
            Areas with comprehensive geologic hazard map data are shown with red polygons. Statewide data for hazardous (Quaternary age) faults, and a legacy compilation of landslides are also available. Limited, comprehensive geologic hazard map data are available for the remaining hazards listed in the Legend. Hazard map layers can be enabled in the Legend by clicking on the eye symbol. Map layer units describing the hazard relative susceptibility are also shown in the Legend. The absence of data does not imply that no geologic hazard or hazards exist. Additional geologic hazard mapping is on-going and will be added to the database as it is finalized.
